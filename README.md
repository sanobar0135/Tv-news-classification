Machine Learning Classification Project – SVM Format Dataset

This repository contains a complete Machine Learning pipeline for training, evaluating, and comparing ML models using a dataset provided in SVMlight (.svm) format.
The project demonstrates data preprocessing, EDA, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization.

🔥 Features

Loads SVMlight-format dataset
Performs full preprocessing (scaling, cleaning, encoding)
Exploratory Data Analysis with graphs
Trains multiple ML models
Model comparison using metrics
Generates ROC curves, confusion matrices, feature importance, etc.
Clean, modular code structure

📝 Project Workflow
